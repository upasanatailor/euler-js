# EulerJS1

This repo contains solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems in pure JavaScript.
It's a fun (aka. useless) node cli that you can pass the ID of the problem to and it will tell you the solution.
We do not claim to have the most elegant solutions, but solutions nonetheless.
